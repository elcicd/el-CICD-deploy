.Features demonstrated
****
* Templating deployment definitions without the use of Helm templates, and only using values.yaml file(s).
* Defining arbitrary el-CICD Chart variables in deployment definitions.
* Using el-CICD Chart variables as templates.
* Easily mounting ConfigMaps in Pods with the projectedVolumes helper attribute.
****

Both <<el-CICD Chart Templates>> and <<Compound el-CICD Chart Templates>> made use of el-CICD Chart's built-in variables to help define their host domain.  This part of the tutorial will focus on user-defined variables.

A fundamental goal of el-CICD Chart is to eliminate Helm templates and move all template creation, among other things, into the values.yaml file(s).  This part of the tutorial, where arbitrary values are defined within the values.yaml file, is where that functionality begins to be demonstrated.

==== Create and save the following file as `elcicd-demo-3.yaml`

[source,YAML,linenums]
----
elCicdDefs: # <1>
  INDEX_HTML_NAME: index.html
  DEFAULT_PAGE_CONTENT: <h1>Howdy from $<OBJ_NAME> in release $<HELM_RELEASE_NAME>!<h1>
  PAGE_CONTENT: $<DEFAULT_PAGE_CONTENT>
  HTML_PAGE: <!DOCTYPE html><html><body>$<PAGE_CONTENT></body></html>

  INDEX_HTML_NAME: index.html
  PAGE_CONTENT: <h1>Howdy from $<OBJ_NAME> in release $<HELM_RELEASE_NAME>!<h1>
  HTML_PAGE: |-
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <body>
        <h1>$<PAGE_CONTENT></h1>

elCicdTemplates:

  image: registry.redhat.io/rhel8/httpd-24
  host: httpd-$<NAME_SPACE>.apps-crc.testing
  projectedVolumes: # <2>
  - name: $<HELM_RELEASE_NAME>
    mountPath: /var/www/html/
    configMaps:

  data:
    $<OBJ_NAME>: $<HTML_PAGE> # <3>

<1> All el-CICD Chart variables are defined under maps starting with `elCicdDefs`.
.. Keys in the `elCicdDefs` map are the names of the variables.
.. By convention and similar to shell scripting, variable names are ALL CAPS snake case.
.. Defining variables and their can be any valid YAML.
.. Variables are referenced using the syntax `$<VARIABLE_NAME>`.
.. Variables values can reference other variables.
... The order variables are declared is irrelevant.
... Variable names can be dynamically generated
.... `$<HELM_RELEASE_NAME>` is another built-in el-CICD Chart variable that corresponds to `.Release.Name` in a Helm template.
.... $<HELM_RELEASE_NAME>_foo: some-value` will generate a new value derived from the name of the release.
<2> `projectedVolumes` is a helper attribute for generating https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/projected-volumes/[projectedVolumes].
.. In this example it will generate a `volume` entry for ConfigMap in the Deployment.
.. It will also create a volumeMount of the `volume` on the container at the given `mountPath`.
.. Per the projectedVolume standard, any number of ConfigMaps, Secrets, etc., can be listed.
<3> `objName` is a helper attribute that will render as the name of a resource or resources; i.e.`metadata.name`.
.. `$<OBJ_NAME>` is another built-in el-CICD Chart variable referring to the el-CICD Chart template's objName in which it is realized.
.. `objName` and `OBJ_NAME` will default to the chart's release name, `HELM_RELEASE_NAME`, if left undefined by the user.

==== Tutorial steps

.What to expect
****
* An httpd Pod will be created and accessible from outside the cluster using a single, compound el-CICD Chart templates.
* The el-CICD Chart templates used will include a single, compound single, compound el-CICD Chart template created from the deployment, service, and ingress.
* A Deployment, Service, and Ingress will be deployed on the cluster using el-CICD Chart.
* The index.html web page will be generated from an template made up of multiple el-CICD Chart variables. 
* A ConfigMap containing generated index.html file will be deployed to the cluster and mounted inside the httpd Pod, and be visible within the browser.
