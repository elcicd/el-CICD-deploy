.Features demonstrated
****
* Defining compound templates.
* Reducing boilerplate YAML using common el-CICD Chart templates helper attributes.
****

In <<el-CICD Chart Templates>>, we demonstrated the conciseness and modularity el-CICD Chart templates.  We will now show how to combine multiple, related el-CICD Chart templates into a single __compound template__ for even more concise deployment definitions.

TIP: **Any el-CICD Chart built-in template can be compounded into a single template definition as long as any common helper attributes refer to the same, basic data.**

==== Create and save the following file as `elcicd-demo-2.yaml`

[source,YAML,linenums]
----
elCicdTemplates:
- templateNames: [deployment, service, ingress] # <.>
  image: registry.redhat.io/rhel8/httpd-24
  host: httpd-$<HELM_RELEASE_NAMESPACE>.apps-crc.testing
  port: 8081 # <.>
  targetPort: 8080 # <.>
----
[TIP]
====
YAML is a superset of JSON; thus YAML will interpret both `[deployment, service, ingress]` and
[source,YAML,linenums]
----
templateNames:
- deployment
- service
- ingress
----
as lists.
====

<.> Compound templates are defined as a list under the `templateNames` attribute, versus `templateName` for a single template.

<.> In compound templates, all helper attributes are shared among the el-CICD templates.
.. `image` is unique to the `deployment` template.
.. `host` is unique to the `ingress` el-CICD Chart template.
.. `port` is shared and used by all three listed el-CICD Chart templates.
.. `targetPort` is shared by the `service` and `deployment` templates, and take precedence over the `port` attribute when defined.

NOTE: In the first part of the tutorial, <<el-CICD Chart Templates>>, we promised to explain why we contrived a different port and target port, and it was to better demonstrate how shared helper attributes would behave in compound templates.

==== Tutorial steps

.What to expect
****
* A Deployment, Service, Ingress, and ConfigMap will be deployed on the cluster using el-CICD Chart.
* An httpd Pod will be created from the Deployment and accessible in the browser from outside the cluster.
* The httpd server's test page will be reachable and visible in the browser.
