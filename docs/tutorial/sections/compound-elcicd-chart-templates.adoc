.Features demonstrated
****
* Creating compound templates by combining el-CICD Chart templates.
* Leveraging helper attributes within compound el-CICD Chart templates.
****

In <<el-CICD Chart Templates>>, we demonstrated how concise and modular el-CICD Chart templates can be when defining deployments.  We will now show how to combine el-CICD Chart templates into single, __compound template__ for even more concise deployment definitions.

TIP: **Any el-CICD Chart built-in template can be compounded into a single template definition as long as any overlapping helper attributes refer to the same data.**

==== Create and save the following file as `elcicd-demo-2.yaml`

[source,YAML,linenums]
----
elCicdTemplates:
- templateNames: [deployment, service, ingress] # <1>
  image: registry.redhat.io/rhel8/httpd-24
  host: httpd-$<HELM_RELEASE_NAMESPACE>.apps-crc.testing
  port: 8081 # <2>
  targetPort: 8080 # <2>
----

<1> Compound templates are listed under the `templateNames` attribute, versus the `templateName` for a single attribute.
.. Since YAML is superset of JSON, we can use JSON list notation if we wish.
.. The `templateName` attribute is merely a convenience when rendering a single template.
<2> In compound templates, all helper attributes are shared among the el-CICD templates.
.. `image` is unique to the deployment template.
.. `host` is unique to the ingress el-CICD Chart template.
.. `port` is shared and used by all three listed el-CICD Chart templates.
.. `targetPort` is shared by the service and deployment templates, and take precedence over the `port` attribute when defined.

NOTE: In <<el-CICD Chart Templates>>, we promised to explain why we contrived a different port and target port as a tutorial contrivance, and it was to demonstrate how overlapping helper attributes would behave in compound templates.

==== Tutorial steps

.What to expect
****
* An httpd Pod will be created and accessible from outside the cluster using a single, compound el-CICD Chart templates.
* The el-CICD Chart templates used will include a single, compound single, compound el-CICD Chart template created from the deployment, service, and ingress.
* A Deployment, Service, and Ingress will be deployed on the cluster using el-CICD Chart.
* The httpd server's test page will be reachable and visible in the browser.
