=== Deployment Profiles

.Features demonstrated
****
* Defining and deploying with arbitrary el-CICD Chart deployment profiles.
* `elCicdDefs-*` variable map definitions.
* Using el-CICD Chart matrices to deploy copies of the same el-CICD Chart template.
****

In <<User-defined Variables>>, we demonstrated how to define and reference your own variables in your deployment definitions. In this part of the tutorial you'll learn about deployment profiles.  While the previous parts of the tutorial have focused on el-CICD Chart's strengths with regards to templating, readability, and conciseness, it's the deployment profiles that give el-CICD Chart its power.  This feature makes it much, much easier for users to manage a deployment definition across numerous environments with minimal configuration, because whole swaths of variable definitions and templates can be configured with under a single profile.

Example use cases for deployment profiles::
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process[SDLC,window=read-later] 
+
Development, test, and production environments almost always vary in how they're configured for deployment.
* Different locales
+
Different nations, as well the provinces or states within them, tend to have different regulatory and/or language requirements between them.
* High availability and persistence options
+
One or more services of an an application need to be deployed as highly available and/or with data persistence options, either in production or for testing purposes.

Deployment profiles are most useful in any case where the same service or application needs to be deployed differently in more than one situation or environment, which is almost always.

<.> Deployment profiles are declared whenever an el-CICD Chart template and/or `elCicdDefs` variable map is marked for them.
.. Deployment profiles must consist of upper case alphanumeric characters, '_' or '.', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
.. `elCicdDefs-$<MULTI_LINGUAL_PROFILE>` declares the `$<MULTI_LINGUAL_PROFILE>` (`MULTI_LINGUAL`) profile.
... Variables and values defined under this map will only be realized when the `MULTI_LINGUAL` profile is active.
... `elCicdDefs` maps may only reference one profile at a time.
.. `mustHaveAnyProfile` similarly declares the `$<MULTI_LINGUAL_PROFILE>` (`MULTI_LINGUAL`) profile.
... The `[$<ENGLISH>, $<ESPANOL>]` configMap template will only be processed when the `MULTI_LINGUAL` profile is active.
... The full list of template discriminators is
.... `mustHaveAnyProfile`
.... `mustHaveEveryProfile`
.... `mustNotHaveAnyProfile`
.... `mustNotHaveEveryProfile`
<.> If keys in maps or values in maps or lists evaluate to empty or null values after processing, they will be removed.
.. `$<ENGLISH>` and `$<ESPANOL>` will only be realized if the `MULTI_LINGUAL` deployment profile is active.
.. If the `MULTI_LINGUAL` deployment profile is inactive, the keys evaluate to null, and each member of the `configMaps` list is removed.
<.> `objNames` is one of two el-CICD Chart matrices that can be defined on an el-CICD Chart template.
.. Matrices are lists that will tell el-CICD Chart to generate a copy of the template for each element in the list.
.. `objName` will be assigned for each copy corresponding to an element in the `objNames` list used to generate it.
.. All elements of the `objNames` matrix must follow the same naming rules as `metadata.name`.
.. This deployment definition will result in two configMap templates, `$<ENGLISH>` (`english.html) and `$<ESPANOL>` (`espanol.html`).
<.> el-Cicd Chart variables are overridden based on more specific `elCicdDefs` variable maps.
.. `elCicdDefs` variable maps can be declared for specific profiles, a particular `objName`, and/or under specific el-CICD Chart templates.
... `objName` and/or profiles are appended `elCicdDefs` using a `-` as a delimiter; e.g.
... `elCicdDefs-foo` for `objName` `foo`.
... `elCicdDefs-BAR` for defployment profile `BAR`.
... `elCicdDefs-foo-BAR` or `elCicdDefs-BAR-foo` for `objName` `foo` and profile `BAR`.
... Variable references in lieu of static declarations, e.g. elCicdDefs-$<MULTI_LINGUAL_PROFILE>.
+
If a variable map name ends with `-` (e.g. `elCicdDefs-`or `elCicdDefs-foo-`) because a variable in the name was undefined, the map will be ignored.
... Top level `elCicdDefs` maps are processed first, and the process is repeated for each el-CICD Chart template maps as they are processed.
.... This means that every el-CICD Chart template specific variable map has precedence over all top level maps.
.... Order of precedence of maps, from least to greatest:
+
CAUTION: This is **not** a comprehensive list.

* `elCicdDefs`
* `elCicdDefs-<__profile-name__>`: variables defined for an active profile.
* `elCicdDefs-<__objName__>`: variables defined for a specific `objName` match.
* `elCicdDefs-<__profile-name__>-<__objName__>`: variables defined for an active profile and specific `objName` match.
* `elCicdDefs-<__objName__>-<__profile-name__>`: variables defined for a specific `objName` match and active profile.

==== Deploy the httpd server without an active deployment profile
:helm-update-command: helm upgrade --install --atomic --history-max=0 -n elcicd-chart-demo --create-namespace -f elcicd-demo-4.yaml elcicd-chart-demo elcicd-charts/elcicd-chart
:result-image: deployment-profiles-default-screenshot.png
:helm-manifest-file: deployment-profiles-default-manifest
:kubectl-get-file: deployment-profiles-default-kubectl-get

Deploying without a deployment profile with the above deployment definition will look identical to the <<User-defined Variables>> demonstration in every way.  The lack of a proper active profile in this deployment means all the additions made to the deployment definition in `elcicd-demo-4.yaml` compared to `elcicd-demo-3.yaml` will be ignored.

==== Tutorial steps

.What to expect
****
* An httpd Pod will be created and accessible in the browser from outside the cluster.
* A Deployment, Service, and Ingress will be deployed on the cluster using el-CICD Chart.
* An index.html web page will be generated from multiple el-CICD Chart variables. 
* A ConfigMap containing the generated index.html file will be deployed to the cluster, mounted inside the httpd Pod, and be visible within the browser.

==== Install the httpd server with the `MULTI_LINGUAL` deployment profile
:helm-update-command: helm upgrade --install --atomic --history-max=0 -n elcicd-chart-demo --create-namespace --set elCicdProfiles='{MULTI_LINGUAL}' -f elcicd-demo-4.yaml elcicd-chart-demo elcicd-charts/elcicd-chart
:result-image: deployment-profiles-multi-lingual-screenshot.png
:helm-manifest-file: deployment-profiles-multi-lingual-manifest
:kubectl-get-file: deployment-profiles-multi-lingual-kubectl-get

el-CICD Chart deployment profiles are defined in `elCicdProfiles` as a list.  It only makes sense to define the active profile list outside of the deployment definition and at deployment time, or that would defeat their purpose.  The `helm update --install` command is modified to apply deployment profile `--set elCicdProfiles='{MULTI_LINGUAL}'` clause.  If more than one deployment profile is specified, the order of precedence is from least to greatest in determining the values of variables; e.g. if `elCicdProfiles={FOO,BAR}`, all values defined in the `BAR` profile would take precedence over `FOO`.

This part of the demonstration will change the opening page to a pair of links that will take you to either English or Spanish versions of the "Howdy!" message.
