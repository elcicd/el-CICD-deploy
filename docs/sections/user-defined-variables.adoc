Both <<el-CICD Chart Templates>> and <<Compound el-CICD Chart Templates>> made use of el-CICD Chart's built-in variables to help define their host domain.  This part of the tutorial will focus on user-defined variables.

====
.Features demonstrated
* Defining arbitrary el-CICD Chart variables in deployment definitions.
* Using el-CICD Chart variables as templates for other values or even scripts.
* Easily mounting ConfigMaps with the projectedVolumes helper attribute.

. Create and save the following file and name it `elcicd-demo-3.yaml`:

.. All el-CICD Chart variables are defined under a map called `elCicdDefs`.
... Keys in the `elCicdDefs` map are the names of the variables.
... By convention and similar to shell scripting, variable names are ALL CAPS snake case.
... Defining variables and their can be any valid YAML.
... Variables are referenced using the syntax `$<VARIABLE_NAME>`.
... Variables values can reference other variables.
.... The order variables are declared is irrelevant.
.... Variable names can be dynamically generated
..... `$<HELM_RELEASE_NAME>` is another built-in el-CICD Chart variable that corresponds to `.Release.Name` in a Helm template.
..... $<HELM_RELEASE_NAME>_foo: some-value` will generate a new value derived from the name of the release.
.. `projectedVolumes` is a helper attribute for generating https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/projected-volumes/[projectedVolumes].
... In this example it will generate a `volume` entry for ConfigMap in the Deployment.
... It will also create a volumeMount of the `volume` on the container at the given `mountPath`.
... Per the projectedVolume standard, any number of ConfigMaps, Secrets, etc., can be listed.
.. `objName` is a helper attribute that will render as the name of a resource or resources; i.e.`metadata.name`.
... `$<OBJ_NAME>` is another built-in el-CICD Chart variable referring to the el-CICD Chart template's objName in which it is realized.
... `objName` and `OBJ_NAME` will default to the chart's release name, `HELM_RELEASE_NAME`, if left undefined by the user.
